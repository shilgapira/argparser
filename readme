NAME
	argparser - Argument parser.

DESCRIPTION
	Argparser is a C library that makes it easy to write
	user-friendly command-line interfaces. The program
	defines what arguments it requires, and argparser
	will figure out how to parse those out.

	Argparser does not use heap memory allocation,
	and has an intuitive API. Maybe code looks heavy,
	but after compilation, it is really tidy thing.
	The library will store all data in cache, but
	the parser is created for multiple usages.

RATIONALE
	Using getopts from <unistd.h> is fine, until
	we have too much time. Reading over and over
	again manpages and creating program on
	unreadable and bloated code is frustrating.

USAGE
	We have four structs and one global variable,
	and that's all we should be interested in.
	Variable 'argparser' is created becouse of
	my own preference. it works like main module
	with one function (new). We call
	argparser.new(void) to get a new parser with
	a cleaned cache. There is small example:
	struct argparser *parser = argparser.new();
	After initialization, we get a pointer to our
	new struct. We can call every function inside;
	it looks like an object. Don't worry function
	calls and anything else will be stripped during
	compilaton. How to use the rest of functions?
	All functions are explained in header.
	Thats all, have a nice day!
